# Black-Out
*currently a work in progress*


Black-Out is a simple study tool for memorization of key terms. Users have the option to enter a sentence as show below, and to delete them by clicking on the box that appears beside each sentence.

The user can then select the key word they want to memorize, and click "highlight" to block the word out. Now, the word which the user wants to memorize, is covered up. The blocked out word will be revealed when the user hovers their mouse over it, but blocked again once the mouse leaves the word. This is a quick and easy way for users to check their answers, which they enter in the text field next to the sentence. The "shuffle" button is useful when the user has many sentences, as it reorders them to help with more effective recall and memorization.
